## CornerShop Database SQL Repository 🛒🏪✨

This repository holds the SQL files and schema design for the **CornerShop** database, modeling a small retail business's transactions, inventory, customers, and suppliers.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started: Setup Instructions

The primary setup file is **`CornerShop_Foreigh.sql`**, which contains the schema creation script generated by MySQL Workbench.

1.  **Preparation:** Ensure you have a **MySQL server** running (preferably MySQL 8.0 or later).
2.  **Execution:** Run the `CornerShop_Foreigh.sql` script in your MySQL client.
3.  **Result:** The script will automatically:
    * Create a schema named **`cornershop`**.
    * Define the table structures and enforce constraints.

## 🔎 Database Schema Overview 📖

The database is structured to manage retail operations, linking customers, products, and suppliers through the core `orders` and `order_details` tables.

| Table Name | Description | Primary Key (PK) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`coustomers`** 🧑 | Stores customer personal and contact information. | `Customer_ID` |
| **`suppliers`** 🏭 | Stores details of vendors providing products. | `Supplier_ID` |
| **`products`** 🛍️ | Stores inventory details, including pricing and supplier linkage. | `Product_ID` |
| **`orders`** 🧾 | Records high-level order information (who placed it, when). | `Order_ID` |
| **`order_details`** 🏷️ | Breaks down each order into specific product items and quantities purchased. | Composite PK: (`Order_ID`, `Product_ID`) |

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 🗺️

## 🔗 Key Relationships (Foreign Keys) 🤝

These relationships enforce data integrity and enable powerful join operations across the tables.

| Source Table (Child) | Foreign Key | References (Parent Table) | Relationship Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`products`** 🛍️ | `Supplier_ID` | `suppliers(Supplier_ID)` | Many-to-One (Products to Supplier) |
| **`orders`** 🧾 | `Customer_ID` | `coustomers(Customer_ID)` | Many-to-One (Orders to Customer) |
| **`order_details`** 🏷️ | `Order_ID` | `orders(Order_ID)` | Many-to-One (Detail lines to Order) |
| **`order_details`** 🏷️ | `Product_ID` | `products(Product_ID)` | Many-to-One (Detail lines to Product) |

## 💡 Key SQL Concepts and Functions in Schema Creation

The `CornerShop_Foreigh.sql` file primarily focuses on schema definition. Here are the core SQL concepts utilized:

### 1. Schema Definition and Data Types 🛠️

| SQL Command/Concept | Description | Function in CornerShop Schema |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`CREATE SCHEMA`** | Command used to create a new database container. | Creates the **`cornershop`** database. |
| **`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`** | Defines a new table structure only if the table does not already exist. | Defines all five tables with columns and constraints. |
| **`INT NOT NULL`** | Data type for integers that cannot contain null values. | Used for all primary keys (e.g., `Customer_ID`) and required numeric fields. |
| **`VARCHAR(45)`** | Data type for variable-length strings, limited to 45 characters. | Used for names, addresses, and email fields. |

### 2. Integrity Constraints & Rules 🔒

| Constraint/Rule | Description | Purpose in CornerShop Schema |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`PRIMARY KEY`** | A constraint that **uniquely identifies** each record in a table. | Guarantees unique identification for customers, products, etc. |
| **`FOREIGN KEY`** | A constraint linking a column in one table (child) to the primary key of another table (parent). | Enforces referential integrity between tables. |
| **`ON DELETE NO ACTION`** | **Referential Integrity Rule:** Rejects deletion of a parent record if dependent child records exist. | Prevents accidental deletion of customers or products that have existing orders. |
| **`ON UPDATE CASCADE`** | **Referential Integrity Rule:** If the primary key in the parent table is updated, the foreign key in the child table is automatically updated to match. | Ensures consistency if ID numbers need to be changed. |
